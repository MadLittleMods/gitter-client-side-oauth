# Gitter client-side OAuth demo

**Note:** This currently doesn't work unless you disable web security in the browser. We are currently waiting on [gitterHQ/gitter#533](https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter/issues/533) to be implemented in order to work without any caveats.

You can view the offical documentation for oauth authenticatio with Gitter here: https://developer.gitter.im/docs/authentication

## [Live Demo](http://madlittlemods.github.io/gitter-client-side-oauth/)

# Get Started (guide, instructions)

 1. Visit https://developer.gitter.im/apps and setup an app. The name can be anything and the redirect URI should point back to this page `http://localhost:3000`, etc.
 1. Use those credentials in the inputs and press "Start Authorization".
 1. Check the devtools console for any info and errors

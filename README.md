# Gitter client-side OAuth demo

**Note:** This currently doesn't work unless you disable web security in the browser. We are currently waiting on [gitterHQ/gitter#533](https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter/issues/533) to be implemented in order to work without any caveats.

You can view the offical documentation for oauth authenticatio with Gitter here: https://developer.gitter.im/docs/authentication
